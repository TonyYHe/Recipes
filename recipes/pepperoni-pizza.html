        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees C. Grease two 12-inch pizza 
            pans.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, 
            garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium 
            bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large 
            bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 
            minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a 
            soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth 
            and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. 
            (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 
            minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece 
            of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is 
            bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and 
            bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
